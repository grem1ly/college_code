# College Code

This repository contains the various code I've written throughout my college career. Each subdirectory consists of projects related to a specific programming language. Each project within each subdirectory has a corresponding README.md that explains the overall objective, relevant analyses, and explanations for how to run the specific scripts<sup id="ref1">[1](#foot1)</sup> (if necessary).

**Note:** Only Python related projects have been uploaded at this time. More are to come.
